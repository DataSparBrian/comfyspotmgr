# ðŸš§ Configuration Templates - Work in Progress

This directory will contain pre-configured setups for different ComfyUI use cases.

## Planned Templates

### Personal Use Cases
- [ ] **minimal-cost/** - Cheapest possible setup for experimentation
- [ ] **balanced/** - Good balance of performance and cost for regular use
- [ ] **performance/** - Maximum performance for intensive workflows
- [ ] **learning/** - Beginner-friendly configuration with extra documentation

### Project Types  
- [ ] **art-generation/** - Optimized for artistic image generation
- [ ] **upscaling/** - Configured for image upscaling workflows
- [ ] **batch-processing/** - Setup for processing many images
- [ ] **experimentation/** - Quick setup/teardown for trying new models

## Template Structure

Each template will include:

```
template-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tfvars    # Pre-configured settings
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # What this setup is good for
â””â”€â”€ models.txt          # Recommended models list
```

## Usage

1. **Pick a Template**: Choose what matches your use case
2. **Copy Settings**: Copy terraform.tfvars to your project root  
3. **Tweak if Needed**: Adjust for your specific needs
4. **Deploy**: Run `make setup` and `make apply`

## Why Templates?

- **Save Time**: No need to research optimal settings
- **Avoid Mistakes**: Pre-tested configurations
- **Learn**: See what works for different use cases
- **Cost Control**: Know what you're spending upfront

## Current Status

**Maybe Later:** Basic templates for common hobby use cases  
**Future Idea:** Regional variations for different GCP regions

*Note: This is a hobby project - these are just ideas for making setup easier, not enterprise requirements!*

*Templates are part of the ComfySpotMgr project - see the main [README](../../README.md) for current functionality.*
